    <string name="content">A blockchain [originally block chain] is a distributed database that maintains a continuously-growing list of ordered records called blocks.Each block contains a timestamp and a link to a previous block.By design blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data - once recorded, the data in a block cannot be altered retroactively.</string>
    <string name="content1">Blockchains are secure by design and an example of a distributed computing system with high byzantine fault tolerance.Decentralised consensus can therefore be achieved with a blockchain.This makes blockchains suitable for the recording of events, title, medical records and other records management activities,identity management, transaction processing and proving provenance.[citation needed] This offers the potential of mass disintermediation and vast repercussions for how global trade is conducted.The first blockchain was conceptualised by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 and implemented the following year as a core component of the digital currency bitcoin,where it serves as the public ledger for all transactions.Through the use of a peer-to-peer network and a distributed timestamping server a blockchain database is managed autonomously.The invention of the blockchain for bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the double spending problem.The bitcoin design has been the inspiration for other applications.</string>
    <string name="content2">History\nFirst work on cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.Followed by publications in 1996 by Ross J. Anderson and 1998 by Bruce Schneier and John Kelsey.In parallel there was work going on in 1998 by Nick Szabo working on a mechanism for a decentralized digital currency that he called bit gold.In 2000 Stefan Konst published a general theory for cryptographic secured chains and suggested a set of solutions for implementation.</string>
